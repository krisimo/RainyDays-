# Rainydays – Cross-Course Project

## Project Overview

Rainydays is an e-commerce concept built for a fictional brand that sells high-performance jackets for outdoor motorcycle adventures in wet and windy weather. The website was created during the Cross-Course Assignment to demonstrate responsive layout, user interface design, and basic front-end e-commerce structure.

The site includes:
- Product listing and category filtering
- A product detail view
- Add/remove functionality for a shopping cart
- Checkout flow with order confirmation

## Built With

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript 

## ✍What I Would Improve

Since completing this project, I would like to:
- Improve cart state handling using localStorage or sessionStorage
- Refactor the JavaScript to be more modular and readable
- Improve accessibility (alt texts, semantic elements)
- Use CSS variables more consistently for easier theming

## What I Learned

- How to structure a multi-page static site
- Basic product interaction logic (add to cart, view cart)
- Improving layout responsiveness for mobile and desktop
- File structure organization and deployment via Netlify

## Reflections

This was one of the first projects where I really started thinking about user flow in an online shop. It helped me understand the importance of structure and how simple interactivity can dramatically improve the user experience.
